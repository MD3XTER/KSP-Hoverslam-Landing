# KSP - Hoverslam Landing (KRPC - Java)

This is my attempt to reproduce the SpaceX Hoverslam landing. I am using [KRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/getting-started.html) mod for communicating with the KSP client.

The algorithm it's not finished yet, there are a lot more things to work on. So any help is very welcome.
